# Zotero extension - Add Collection Tag

When a new item is added to a collection with the Zotero Connector (i.e., the Web browser extension), this plugin will automatically tag the item and the related attachement with the name of the **currently selected** collection or sub collection in Zotero.

```
My Library:
|_Collection 1
  |_New item added + related attachements (e.g., a PDF)
```

Then the plugin will automatically add the tag `Collection 1` to the item and the related attachements.
